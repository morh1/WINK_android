## Introduction

WINK Chat Application is a versatile chat platform that enables real-time communication between users. It consists of both a web application and an Android app, ensuring users can chat conveniently from their preferred devices.

### Features

- **Cross-Platform**: Users can chat seamlessly across web browsers and Android devices.
- **Efficient Server**: The server is built using Node.js with the Express framework, providing an efficient and scalable foundation for the application.
- **Database**: MongoDB is used to store and retrieve chat data securely.
- **Web Client**: The web client is developed using React, offering a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Socket.IO is implemented for real-time messaging capabilities.
- **Android App**: An Android app has been created using Android Studio to extend the application's reach.
- **Android Real-Time Communication**: Firebase is used for real-time communication in the Android app.
- **Offline Functionality**: SQLite provides local storage for offline functionality in the Android app.

## Architecture

The WINK Chat Application is built on a robust architecture that ensures efficiency and reliability:

- **Server**: The server is built on a RESTful API architecture using Node.js with the Express framework. It handles client requests, manages user accounts, and facilitates real-time messaging using Socket.IO. MongoDB is used as the database to store chat data securely.

- **Web Client**: The web client is constructed with React, providing users with a responsive and intuitive interface. Users can register, log in, and send and receive real-time messages through the server.

- **Android App**: The Android app is developed using Android Studio, extending the application's reach to Android users. Firebase is used to facilitate real-time messaging in the app, and SQLite is employed for local storage, enabling users to access messages even when offline.The app consists of five main screens:<br />
  the Log In screen, the Sign Up screen, the Chat screen, the Contact screen, and the Settings screen.
